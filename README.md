# CalypsoGraph

C Program for operating on Graphs and Networks fast

RULES:
- camelCase only 
- except TypeNames (i.e. struct type id thingys)
- please do things iteratively unless you know recursion is faster in the specific case, as pushing and popping stack frames is expensive
- minimize mallocing and freeing because it's slow
- code as modularly as possible: if we have to update a data structure or algorithm for space/time reqs, we don't want to break everything
- you can use any IDE you want, but it is our official position that using VIM to look cool is the opposite of cool
